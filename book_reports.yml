               I am throwing in the towell on Chris Voss "Never Split the Difference", intent on revisting. Splitting the difference means meeting someone halfway on let's say "whatever". 
               It could be your hair appointment, or your kids situation, or car buying. Splitting the difference refers to the compromises we make so often in life. Compromises, according
               to Voss are a social construct that makes people save face and settle for less.
                Who is Chris Voss? He is an ex-kansas beat cop turned FBI hostage negotiator. The book tells the story of how he grew as a person to become, literally, a lifesaver: because
                when a life is on the line you can't afford to lose. 
                I listened to the book on hoopla from the Bud Werner Library, where John Major, Amy, Tanya, and Katy work, 1 time and part of a second time, which is why I say I threw in
                the towell. This book impacted my life in a big way. It changed thought processes I carry. How are you doing has a new meaning for me. And while I haven't mastered
                every skill or tactic in the book, in fact I am a big chicken in almost everyway still, I believe getting there is a sure matter: You wouldn't like to die would you? Think
                how painful and scary that would be? Come with me and I'll show you a way to a better life!
